# Predicting taxi fares in NYC

This is a full workflow for producing a machine learning model to predict taxi fares in NYC. 

The data used is from Google's Kaggle competition here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction

To run the notebook yourself, download the data and set the filepath in the second code cell appropriately. The filename is hard coded in the same cell as 'train.csv', so change appropriate if needed.
